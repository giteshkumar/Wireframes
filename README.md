Wire framing is a way to design a website service at the structural level.
It is used to layout content and functionality on a page which takes into account user needs and user journeys.
It was used early in the development process to establish the basic structure of a page before visual design and content is added.
Wireframing is essential in UI design:-
A wireframe is a layout of a web page that demonstrates what interface elements will exist on key pages. It is a critical part of the interaction design process.
The Aim of a wireframe is to provide a visual understanding of a page early in a project to get stakeholder and project team approval before the creative phase gets under way. 
Wireframes can also be used to create the global and secondary navigation to ensure the terminology and structure used for the site meets user expectations.
Wireframes should be used early in a project to get user and client approval on the layout of key pages and the navigation.
